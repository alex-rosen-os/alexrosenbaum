Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex ðŸŒ±

Currently working as a Technical Support Team Lead & QA at a web based company. 

Passionate about web development, constantly learning & expanding my knowledge base. 

I like using different tools & programs, learning different structures & how they work within a system.

My learning is vertical, rather then hierarchal: I move & mix between subjects & systems, 
returning to started projects, 

continuing development from different perspective & knowledge base.
