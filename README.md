Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex ðŸŒ±

Currently working as a Technical Support Team Lead & QA at a web based company. 
Passionate about web development, Constantly learning & expanding my knowledge base. 
my learning is vertical, rather then hierarchal. i move & mix between subjects & systems, returning to started projects & creating new ones as i move through.
i like using different tools, programs and systems, learning different structures & how they work within a system.
